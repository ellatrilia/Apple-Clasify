# Apple-Clasify
This tutorial explains how to train, detect, and classify apples based on color (red, yellow, green) using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model.

**Training Model to Get Better Accuracy**

## Prepare Dataset
   * Source dataset: [Apple Annotation with Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/tugas-akhir-70fw5/apel-mrg3l/dataset/1).
   * The dataset has been annotated using the Roboflow platform.
   * Augmentations applied: blur, shear, rotation to improve model robustness.

## Train the Model Using YOLOv8
